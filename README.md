## Integrated Lab Companion (ILC)

## Overview

The Integrated Lab Companion (ILC) is a sophisticated tool designed to enhance the experimental capabilities of electrical and computer engineering laboratories. Developed as a capstone project at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, the ILC streamlines laboratory processes and integrates advanced technical features to support both students and instructors.

## Key Features

- **Advanced Experimentation**: The ILC provides a comprehensive set of tools for conducting and analyzing experiments in electrical and computer engineering.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed with ease of use in mind, the ILC interface is intuitive for both novices and experienced users.
- **Data Management**: Efficiently manage and store experimental data, ensuring easy access and analysis.

## Confidentiality

For security and confidentiality reasons, the source code provided does not include the description key. This measure ensures the protection of sensitive information and intellectual property associated with the ILC.

## Design Process

### Initial Concept

The idea for the ILC stemmed from the need to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of laboratory sessions for electrical and computer engineering students. The goal was to create a tool that could seamlessly integrate various experimental components, provide real-time data analysis, and offer an intuitive user experience.

### Development

1. **Requirement Analysis**: We conducted thorough research to identify the specific needs of students and instructors. This included surveys, interviews, and analysis of current lab practices.
2. **Prototyping**: Initial prototypes were developed to test the feasibility of our ideas. These prototypes focused on the core functionalities of the ILC.
3. **Iterative Design**: Based on feedback from users and stakeholders, we iteratively refined the design. Each iteration added new features, improved the user interface, and enhanced performance.
4. **Testing**: Extensive testing was conducted to ensure reliability and accuracy. This included unit tests, integration tests, and user acceptance testing.

### Technical Details

- **Architecture**: The ILC is built using a modular architecture that allows for easy updates and maintenance. Each module is responsible for a specific functionality, such as data acquisition, processing, or visualization.
- **Programming Languages**: The core of the ILC is developed in Python, leveraging its extensive libraries for data analysis and user interface design.
- **Database**: A robust database system is used to store experimental data securely, ensuring data integrity and quick access.
- **Installer**: The ILC installer is built using cx_Freeze, which packages the Python application into an executable for easy distribution and installation.

## Installation and Setup
